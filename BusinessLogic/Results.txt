help Tramp - Wikipedia Tramp From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search This article is about vagrants. For other uses, see Tramp (disambiguation) . Look up tramp in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. A romanticized tramp depicted in an 1899 U.S. poster A tramp is a long-term homeless person who travels from place to place as a vagrant , traditionally walking all year round. The word tramp became a common way to refer to such people in 19th-century Britain and America. Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 3 Tramp as promiscuous woman 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Etymology [ edit ] Tramp is derived from a Middle English verb meaning to "walk with heavy footsteps" ( cf. modern English trample ) and to go hiking. In Britain the term was widely used to refer to vagrants in the early Victorian period. The social reporter Henry Mayhew refers to it in his writings of the 1840s and 1850s. By 1850 the word was well established. In that year Mayhew described "the different kinds of vagrants or tramps" to be found in Britain, along with the "different trampers' houses in London or the country". He distinguished several types of tramps, ranging from young people fleeing from abusive families, through to people who made their living as wandering beggars and prostitutes. [1] In the United States, the word became frequently used during the American Civil War , to describe the widely shared experience of undertaking long marches, often with heavy packs. Use of the word as a noun is thought to have begun shortly after the war. A few veterans had developed a liking for the "call of the road", others may have been too traumatised by war time experience to return to settled life. [2] History [ edit ] Main article: Vagrancy (people) "A Tramp's Nest in Ludlow Street ", How the Other Half Lives: Studies Among the Tenements of New York (1890) , by Jacob Riis Wanderers have existed since ancient times. The modern concept of the "tramp" emerges with the expansion of industrial towns in the early nineteenth century, with the consequent increase in migrant labor and pressure on housing. The common lodging house or "doss house" developed to accommodate transients. Urbanisation also led to an increase in forms of highly marginalized casual labor. Mahew identifies the problem of "tramping" as a particular product of the economic crisis of the 1840s known as the Hungry Forties . John Burnett argues that in earlier periods of economic stability "tramping" involved a wandering existence, moving from job to job which was a cheap way of experiencing adventures beyond the "boredom and bondage of village life". [3] The number of transient homeless people increased markedly in the U.S. after the industrial recession of the early 1870s. Initially, the term "tramp" had a broad meaning, and was often used to refer to migrant workers who were looking for permanent work and lodgings. Later the term acquired a narrower meaning, to refer only to those who prefer the transient way of life. [2] Writing in 1877 Allan Pinkerton said: "The tramp has always existed in some form or other, and he will continue on his wanderings until the end of time; but there is no question that he has come into public notice, particularly in America, to a greater extent during the present decade than ever before." [4] Author Bart Kennedy , a self-described tramp of 1900 America, once said "I listen to the tramp, tramp of my feet, and wonder where I was going, and why I was going." [5] [6] John Sutherland (1989) said that Kennedy "is one of the early advocates of 'tramping', as the source of literary inspiration." [6] The tramp became a character trope in vaudeville performance in the late 19th century in the United States. Lew Bloom claimed he was "the first stage tramp in the business". [7] While tramps may do odd jobs from time to time, unlike other temporarily homeless people they do not seek out regular work and support themselves by other means such as begging or scavenging (see Waste picker ). This is in contrast to: bum, a stationary homeless person who does not work, and who begs for a living in one place. hobo , a homeless person who travels from place to place looking for work, often by " freighthopping " (illegally catching rides on freight trains) Schnorrer , a Yiddish term for a person who travels from city to city begging. Both terms, "tramp" and "hobo" (and the distinction between them), were in common use between the 1880s and the 1940s. Their populations and the usage of the terms increased during the Great Depression . Like "hobo" and "bum," the word "tramp" is considered vulgar in American English usage, having been subsumed in more polite contexts by words such as "homeless person" or "vagrant." At one time, tramps were known euphemistically in England and Wales as "gentlemen of the road." Tramp as promiscuous woman [ edit ] Perhaps because female tramps were often regarded as prostitutes, the term tramp came to be used to refer to a promiscuous woman. Initially this was a distinctively American usage. [8] According to Kate Burridge, the term shifted towards this meaning in the 1920s, having previously predominantly referred to men, it followed the path of other similar gender neutral words (such as "slag") to having specific reference to female sexual laxity. [9] The word is also used, with ambiguous irony, in the classic 1937 Rodgers and Hart song The Lady Is a Tramp , which is about a wealthy member of New York high society who chooses a vagabond life in "hobohemia". [10] Other songs with implicit or explicit reference to this usage include Son of Hickory Holler's Tramp and Gypsies, Tramps &amp; Thieves . The use of the word with the explicitly sexual meaning is especially common in hip hop culture. [11] See also [ edit ] Backpacking (travel) Charles Chaplin 's most famous comic invention The Tramp W.

[Source] “ He's a Tramp ” &#8213;Peg The Tramp is the male protagonist from Disney's 1955 animated film Lady and the Tramp , and the tritagonist of the 2001 sequel Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure . Contents [ show ] Background Development In early versions of the script, Tramp was called Homer and although he was first conceived as Lady 's suitor, competing with an early incantation of Boris for her affections, he ended up as her ex-dog pound mate in the final 1943 storyboard pitch. A few years after that version was scrapped, Walt read a story called "Happy Dan the Cynical Dog" in Cosmopolitan Magazine and decided that such a character as him was just was needed to enhance the film. Although Walt wanted his new character to be called Tramp, the animators feared that audiences would take offense in such a name, due to the word's sexual connotations ("the lady is a tramp".) So, they first called him Rags, then Bozo, before Walt insisted that Tramp would be fine.
Design Tramp is a medium-sized mutt, scruffy looking dog. He is mostly medium brown with a light tan muzzle and stomach. He has a cream colored stripe that comes down from his muzzle to his chest (which he passes down to his son Scamp and daughter Danielle). After he is taken in by Jim Dear and Darling, he wears a red collar with a diamond shaped license.
Personality In the first film, Tramp is a very laid-back character and he's more like a kid. He enjoys his rapscallion lifestyle without a family and home. It's implied that he's flirtatious, given his history of having had a multitude of girlfriends. He's known for his street smarts, able to both avoid dog catchers and deal with junkyard dogs. He initially seems cynical about humans, saying how the arrival of a baby is likely to lead to the family dog being pushed aside.
In the sequel, after he and Lady have married and now have a litter of puppies, Tramp's grown accustomed to being a house pet, but still retains his street smarts. He is also portrayed as being a loving yet firm father to his son, Scamp , and his three daughters, Annette, Collette and Danielle .
Appearances Lady and the Tramp Tramp in the original film. Tramp is introduced as a wise-cracking, stray mutt who admires the life of a rogue loner. Often seen alone, the Tramp doesn't appear to have family or friends outside of the local mutts he runs into from time to time, such as Peg and Bull , or Tony and Joe ; two Italian restaurant owners. Nevertheless, he lives his life with a carefree aura and rascally-fun nature. While out and about in New England, where he regularly rests and feast at various restaurants, he overhears Jock and Trusty attempting to explain what a baby is to Lady . Tramp gives his opinion on the matter, which is somewhat negative. Annoyed with Tramp, Jock and Trusty order him out of the yard.
Later on, Tramp rescues Lady, whom he calls "Pidge" from a pack of alley dogs. Lady reveals that she has been muzzled, and so Tramp attempts to help her take it off. He takes her to the local zoo , when he is able to manipulate a beaver into removing the device, by claiming it will help the beaver haul logs. That night, Tramp takes Lady out for a night on the town. he reveals that he goes to different houses each for scraps and that he has a different name at every one of them. That night, he takes Lady to a small Italian restaurant , where they are served spaghetti and meatballs by the owner, Tony. Tramp takes Lady home, but on the way back, she is picked up by the dogcatcher.
After he finds Lady, who has been released from the pound , he attempts to apologize. However, an angered Lady confronts him on rumors she heard at the pound regarding Tramp's multiple past girlfriends. She orders him to leave, which Tramp was very sad that he'll never be a house dog. However, he soon hears Lady barking furiously as if she was in trouble and rushes back. Lady reveals that a rat has gotten into the baby 's room, and so Tramp rushes to stop it. He is able to successfully kill the rat but is found by Aunt Sarah . She calls the dogcatcher to take him to the pound. However, Tramp is released due to the combined efforts of Jock and Trusty, who had overheard the humans talking after they discovered the rat that Tramp had killed.
The next Christmas, it's revealed that Tramp has been made a member of the family by Jim Dear and Darling . He has become the father of four puppies: three girls that look identical Lady and a son that looks identical to him. Tramp was happy for being a house dog instead of being a stray.
Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure Tramp in Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure . The second film shows that Tramp's relationship with his son, Scamp has become somewhat strained due to Scamp's desire to be a "wild dog." One day, Scamp makes a mess in the living room and is chained outside. Even though, Tramp makes an accident to him since he can't stop acting wild on the street. Tramp comes to talk to Scamp, but they soon get into an argument and Tramp leaves.
Later on, Scamp runs away from home and Tramp blames himself for his son leaving home because he was too harsh with him. He realizes that he needs to understand Scamp better. After Scamp joins a dog pack known as the "Junkyard Dogs," Scamp learns of his father's infamous reputation. Unknown to Scamp, the pack's leader, Buster , was once Tramp's protégé, and now seeks revenge on Tramp. Buster later learns that Scamp is his son.
When Scamp is asked by Buster to steal a chicken from his family's picnic, Tramp soon arrives and talk softly to him. He asks Scamp to come home, but Scamp confronts him who he was as a stray and chooses the junkyard life. Tramp feels sad and brokenhearted that Scamp does not want to be a house dog. However, later that night, a young stray ( Angel ) arrives and tells him and Lady that Scamp is in trouble. He and Angel race to the dog pound and Tramp saves Scamp from getting killed by a vicious bull mastiff named Reggie . Later, Scamp apologizes to his father for running away from home, and Tramp in return apologizes to Scamp for being too hard on him. He was thinking that he and Scamp can go to the river to howl, promising to lighten up. Afterward, the dogs reconcile and head home after Scamp retrieves his collar from Buster back at the junkyard . In the end, the family adopts Angel as a member of the family and Tramp was happy that Scamp became a house dog instead of being a stray after all.
Once Upon a Time Tramp, portrayed by Garry Garneau, makes a cameo in human form, in the Season 4 episode "The Apprentice" as a customer of the Italian restaurant where Emma Swan and Captain Hook share a romantic dinner. Tramp shares the famous spaghetti kiss with Lady , herself in human form. Knowing that other animals like Jiminy Cricket and Gus are transformed into humans by the Evil Queen 's curse, it was plausibly effective also for Tramp.

Gallery The Disney Wiki has a collection of images and media related to Tramp . Trivia Tramp's growls and snarls heard during his fight with the rat would later be reused in Old Yeller when Old Yeller had rabies.
When Tramp tells Lady about the downsides of having a baby in the family, he says he's "the voice of experience". When he says that, it implies that he may have been disowned by his original owners because of a baby.
Tramp's breed is possibly Schnauzer.
His name means a person who travels from place to place on foot in search of work, or as a vagrant or beggar.
It would also fit into his lifestyle on how he admired the life of a rogue loner and enjoyed his freedom before settling down to become a house pet.
